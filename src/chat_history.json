Here's a summary of some consequences:\n\n* **Modification of Marriage Contract:**  The court may approve modifications if they don't affect family interests.  Failure to obtain court approval for modifications made by agreement results in no specified penalty, but the modifications would likely be invalid.\n\n* **Invalid Marriage Contract:** If a marriage contract is invalid, the legal regime outlined in Article 48 applies.  No specific penalty is defined for having an invalid contract, but the legal consequences would follow the rules specified in Article 48.\n\n* **Agreements Contrary to Law:**  Several articles (e.g., Articles 52, 53, 51) state that certain agreements contrary to the law (such as those affecting parental rights or cohabitation) shall be of no effect.  This is a consequence, not a specific penalty.\n\n* **Divorce:**  The text outlines procedures for divorce by mutual consent.  A key consequence is that spouses must wait six months before seeking a mutual consent divorce if their marriage lasted less than six months (Article 77.2).  The court may also dismiss a petition and grant a cooling-off period (Article 78).  A failure to meet the conditions for approval of divorce will lead to the rejection of the divorce petition.\n\n* **Marriage Dissolution Due to Violations:**  Articles 31-36 outline grounds for marriage dissolution due to violations of essential conditions (e.g., age, consanguinity, bigamy, violence, error).
